 Replace `'your_slack_bot_token'`, `'your_slack_signing_secret'`, and `'your_openweathermap_api_key'` with your actual tokens and secrets.
 Run the bot with `node slack-weather-bot.js`.
 In Slack, create a new bot and add a slash command (e.g., `/weather`) that points to your server's URL.

Now you can use the `/weather` command followed by a location to get weather information in your Slack channels.
